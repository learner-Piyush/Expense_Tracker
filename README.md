# Expense_Tracker
This is my fully functional Expense Tracker website. It consists of HTML file which is essential for structure, CSS file for design and JS file for functionality.

In this project you have to enter your expense along with it's amount which are text and number input respectively.
Then you have to submit your data with "Add Expense" button.
Once you submit the data, your data will be displayed along with total expense amount.

Logic is simple if you open and look at the JS file.

And yeah I have added icons.

Let me know if you like the design and experience as well
